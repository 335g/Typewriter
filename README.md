`Typewriter` is a Swift Î¼framework for pretty printing.

## Use

You can get rendering pretty `String` to use `prettify/prettyString` in `Typewriter`.

```swift
let doc = Document
	.texts("This is a sample to use Typewriter.")
	.fillSep()
	.hang(2)

var result: String
result = doc.prettify()

///
/// Trailing closure by `prettyString`
///
result = prettyString(width: 15){
    return Document
        .texts("This is a sample to use Typewriter.")
        .fillSep()
        .hang(2)
}
```

- **Document.string**

  `Document.string` is used when you don't need auto linebreak. `"\n"` is changed to linebreak. `Document` confirm to `StringLiteralConvertible`.

  ```swift
  let document = Document.string("abc")

  ///
  /// equal to
  ///   let document: Document = "abc"
  ```

- **Document.texts**

  `Document.texts` is used when you need auto linebreak. Position sandwiching the linebreak is determined by `prettify/prettyString`'s arugments `rule: RenderingRule` & `width: Int`.

  ```swift
  let doc = Document
    .texts("This is a sample to use Typewriter.")
    .fillSep()
    .hang(2)

  var result: String

  /// (1) width: 60 (default)
  result = doc.prettify()
  /// "This is a sample to use Typewriter."

  /// (2) width: 30
  result = doc.prettify(width: 30)
  ///                                  | boundary (30)
  ///                                  |
  ///   "This is a sample to use\n"
  /// + "Typewriter."

  /// (3) width: 15
  result = doc.prettify(width: 15)
  ///                  | boundary (15)
  ///                  |
  ///   "This is a\n"
  /// + "  sample to use\n"
  /// + "  Typewriter."
  ```
